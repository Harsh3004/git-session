ðŸ§® ArrayLib â€” C++ Array Manipulation Library
ðŸ“˜ Overview:
ArrayLib is a lightweight C++ library built to perform basic and advanced operations on arrays.
Itâ€™s developed collaboratively as part of a Git & GitHub learning session to understand real-world team workflows, branching, pull requests, and code reviews.

This project demonstrates how multiple developers can contribute modular code effectively using Git.

ðŸ§© Features
Create, insert, delete array elements
Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Quick)
Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary)
Utility operations (Reverse, Merge, Min, Max, Mean)
Modular structure with headers and source files
Simple test suite to verify functionality
